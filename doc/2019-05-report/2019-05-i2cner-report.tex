\section{Introduction}
We initiated a project in January 2018 to simulate dynamic transition scenarios for the energy industry in Japan to suggest pathways for minimizing carbon emissions. This report is a summary of the progress we have made so far, the challenges we currently face, and the future direction of this research. 

\section{Progress Summary}

\subsection{Accomplishments}

The tasks that we performed can be divided into two categories: technical tasks associated with implementation of details and features in our model, and data collection and organization. Our accomplishments have been:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Installation of and familiarization with VEDA} (January – March 2018) : To model Japan's energy industry, we chose VEDA, a \gls{TIMES} \cite{loulou_documentation_2005} \cite{gargiulo_documentation_2005} generator. We found the format of the developer-prescribed model files restrictive and unsuitable for our purposes. Therefore, we took the time to develop our own model files, which we have progressively refined since then.\\

At the same time, we collected data pertaining to electricity generation and carbon emissions.

\item \textbf{Incorporation of fossil fuel-related data} (April – May 2018): We incorporated data for electricity generation from fossil fuels from the \gls{EDMC} databank\cite{noauthor_energy_2018}, along with creating a simplified demand process reflecting the recent trends in electricity demand in Japan. \\

While collecting this data, we noticed that the \gls{EDMC} databank that we have been relying on has no data for the amount of electricity generated from individual fossil fuels for the years 2011-12. Instead, the amount of electricity generated from coal, oil, and natural gas is lumped together in one category titled "thermal". Further, the 2016 data seems slightly inconsistent across different data tables in the \gls{EDMC} databank. The source of variation in these numbers is likely to be the changes in the electricity distribution system of Japan since 2016.

\item \textbf{Incorporation of nuclear, hydropower and renewables into the model} (June – August 2018): The process of incorporating these into the model was similar to the previous energy sources, but simpler, since the data obtained for these energy sources from \gls{EDMC} was consistent across \gls{EDMC} data tables and secondary sources \cite{noauthor_energy_2018} \cite{noauthor_iea_2017} \cite{noauthor_japan_2017}. We have also included processes for the projected growth of nuclear, solar and wind based on data from various studies, reports and articles. \cite{publicover_japan_2017} \cite{dincer_analysis_2011} \cite{noauthor_geothermal_2018} \cite{heger_wind_2016} \cite{noauthor_operational_2013} \cite{noauthor_electricity_2017}

\item \textbf{Refining CO\textsubscript{2} emission processes} (August – September 2018) : While we had been modelling CO\textsubscript{2} emission processes in parallel with the electricity processes, it was only after incorporating all conventional energy sources that we could move on to fine-tuning CO\textsubscript{2} emission values to ensure they match the actual emissions from Japan. The major obstacle we faced was the absence of data pertaining to electricity generation from individual fossil fuels, with each fossil fuel's energy cycle having different emission coefficients. We estimated the missing figures based on previous years' trends \cite{noauthor_energy_2018} \cite{noauthor_national_2018} and arrived at reasonable estimates of electricity generation, which result in CO\textsubscript{2} emission values that differ from actual values by about 5\% at most.

\item \textbf{October 2018 – April 2019:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Changing simulation timeframe to 2013-2100:} As discussed in the previous report, it became impossible to find exact data for fossil fuels for the years 2010,2011 and 2012, and hence the total CO$_2$ emissions for those years were very slightly off the mark. We sidestepped this problem by changing the initial year to 2013, for which we have exact data from \gls{EDMC} \cite{noauthor_energy_2018}.\\

\item \textbf{Incorporation of semi-discrete investment sizes:} Discrete investment sizes were incorporated in most scenarios \gls{DSCINV} files\cite{gargiulo_documentation_2005}, whereas the slightly improved semi-discrete capacity sizes are incorporated in the \href{https://github.com/arfc/i2cner/tree/master/JPN-Main-Model/active/co2-constrnt-conv-nonuc}{conventional-no-nuclear model}. It is desired that all \gls{DSCINV} files in the remaining three models include a similar semi-discrete capacity installation structure, as this helps eliminate \href{https://github.com/arfc/i2cner/issues/74}{the production-exceeding-demand bug}.\\

\item \textbf{Incorporation of the contribution-to-peak \cite{gargiulo_documentation_2005} factor:} This parameter is defined as the fraction of a resource's capacity that is guaranteed to be available during peak demand. This introduces a notion of an energy resource's reliability, thereby reducing excessive deployment of wind and solar due to their unreliability. The values in the model \cite{kato_energy_2016} do not take into account the true daily or seasonal variation of wind and solar, as they are annually averaged.\\

\item \textbf{Basic \gls{CCS} Implementation} : Some \gls{CCS} data \cite{kato_energy_2016}  was incorporated into \href{https://github.com/arfc/i2cner/tree/master/JPN-Main-Model/active/i2cner-nonuc}{one of the models}. However, no \gls{CCS} gets deployed in our models. We believe  it should be deployed for an intermediate time-period, since in the absence of nuclear, only \gls{CCS} can provide reliable, clean energy in conjunction with renewables. We have identified a few shortcomings in our model, some of which contribute to this problem:

\begin{itemize}

\item Large amounts of wind can be deployed. While we were initially reluctant to hard-code things into our model, we have since realized that Japan will not reach its wind potential for a very long time, due to the unusually steep fall of the seabed away from the coast. \gls{JWPA} projections \cite{heger_wind_2016} are already rather ambitious, and our models should be more closely aligned with them, allowing for at-most a 10-20 \% increase in deployment capacities.

\item Wind is treated as any other energy source, with its variance not truly taken into account (discussed below). Its installed capacity should be matched by storage or natural gas. Possible ways to implement this are discussed later.

\item We may be overestimating \gls{CCS} costs. The costs associated with \gls{CCS} for Japan have been hard to find as Japan, instead of building \gls{CCS} pipelines like the US or China, intends to build a shipping network for offshore storage of captured and compressed CO$_2$. Based on our interaction with our Energy Analysis Division colleagues at Kyushu university, the costs of this are still being explored by the Japanese government.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}


\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions and Model Data}

	Our model focuses on the electricity generation sector. The following assumptions and limitations are present in our model:
	
\begin{enumerate}

\item All the energy generated by a given process is transferred to the grid without losses to satisfy the demand process. Since the \gls{EDMC} data has values in terms of units of electrical energy produced (GWh), we have had no need for incorporating data about raw fossil fuel consumption, plant efficiency, and utilization factors.

\item The coal and natural gas capacities are held constant throughout the simulation.

\item \gls{LCoE} for fossil fuels has been held constant throughout the simulation \cite{chapman_energy_2018} \cite{noauthor_lazards_2017} \cite{noauthor_iea_2017}. \gls{LCoE} projections for wind and solar have been incorporated \cite{noauthor_lazards_2017}. However, the implementation of costs associated with electricity generation is still under-development. 

\item Oil-based electricity has been gradually retired due to the emphasis of the Japanese government on energy self-sufficiency and minimizing costs, and due to a general trend in the \gls{EDMC} data \cite{noauthor_energy_2018} indicating declining use of oil.

\item Nuclear capacity is increased in chunks equivalent to the capacity of GE-Hitachi's \gls{ABWR} \cite{ge_advanced_2007}, which are under consideration for construction \cite{noauthor_electricity_2017}, with efficiency values based on existing \gls{ABWR}s in operation. It has been assumed that there can be as many as 22 \gls{ABWR}s constructed in between 2020-2100, with the number of reactors constructed during the earlier years based on the number of projects currently under consideration for construction, and the pace of construction based on similar reactors constructed in Japan. All nuclear technology, current or future, has a finite lifetime based realistic values.

\item Solar – Any new solar capacity created by the model has been assumed to be non-tracking.

\item Hydropower – held constant at current levels.

\item Geothermal is expanded to its maximum potential \cite{noauthor_geothermal_2018}.

\item The values of electricity generated from coal, oil and natural gas in 2011 and 2012 have been estimated using previous years' values and CO\textsubscript{2} emissions.

\item The CO\textsubscript{2} emission constraints implemented are very lax and not representative of any constraints that the Japanese government or \gls{I$^2$CNER}  wish to implement. Since we do not have accurate data for electricity generated from fossil fuels for the years 2011, 2012, and 2016, we have been focusing our efforts on modelling CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from previous years accurately.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

Based on these assumptions, the model yields the following results for the years 2011-16, which are very close to the actual electricity generation figures supplied by \gls{EDMC}:

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{elc-2016}
\caption{Electricity generated from different sources}
\end{figure}

The emitted CO\textsubscript{2} values for the period 2011-16 are as follows. The error is at most 5.7\% \ref{co2err}, which is due to the aforementioned absence of accurate data for 2011, 2012 and 2016.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Post Hoc Analysis and Challenges} 

The project was significantly delayed due to the quality of the documentation and customer support provided by the VEDA developers. The primitive, black-box like nature of the software often produces inexplicable, illogical results and inhibits efficient debugging. Therefore, while data acquisition and organization proceeded at the originally suggested pace, the incorporation of this data into the model has been behind schedule, by about three months. \\

In addition to having incomplete/inaccurate data for 2011, 2012 and 2016, \gls{EDMC} has been eliminating data related to electricity generation from individual fossil fuels and lumping power from coal, oil, and natural gas into a category called "thermal" in its databank. This complicates the process of estimating CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from these energy sources, since each fossil fuel has a different emission coefficient. Losing the primary data that we have been relying on has affected our pace and the reproducibility of our research significantly. The \gls{EDMC} databank figures in GWh, instead of in tons of coal or oil, have influenced our model's simplistic design, as discussed previously. Our efforts to find similar data have been unsuccessful. Switching to data in terms of the quantity of raw fossil fuels consumed instead of GWh of electricity produced may require a substantial revision of our model. 

\section{Future Work} 

\subsection{Critical Goals}
These targets are urgent and necessary.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Remove pure oil based electricity generation from all models:} We do not think Japan will ever increase its dependence on oil due to its cost, emissions intensity and due to the Japanese goal of increasing energy independence. Current trends support this assumption. While a few models already exclude oil-based energy, other models should also replace it with combined-cycle electricity generation for the sake of consistency.

\item \textbf{Incorporate semi-discrete investment sizes:} As stated previously, all \gls{DSCINV} files must include semi-discrete capacity installation sizes for consistency.

\item \textbf{Restrict maximum wind capacity:} To align the model more closely with JWPA predictions \cite{heger_wind_2016}, the maximum allowed capacities for wind should be reduced in the respective \gls{MaxCAP} files.

\item \textbf{Associate wind (and solar) with natural gas/storage:} There may be two ways to accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}

\item Replace annually averaged capacity factors and/or \gls{C2Peak} factors with seasonal(sumer/winter) and diurnal (day/night) (i.e. SN,SD, WN, WD \cite{gargiulo_documentation_2005} ) capacity factors/\gls{C2Peak} factors. The model may then automatically deploy natural gas to supplement wind and solar. \textbf{This seems to be a more straightforward solution.}

\item Define a relationship between the capacities of wind and natural gas. Since no straightforward way to do this is described in the VEDA documentation \cite{gargiulo_documentation_2005}, this would require utilization of the \gls{TIMES} documentation \cite{loulou_documentation_2005}, the VEDA attributes table, and quite possibly the assistance of the VEDA forum. \textbf{This is the more challenging fix to this problem.}

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Incorporation of Japan-specific costs for wind:} When incorporating \gls{JWPA} predictions, it will be necessary to split off-shore wind into fixed and floating types. The \href{https://github.com/arfc/i2cner/tree/master/data/japan_costs}{cost data} for this already exists in our repository thanks to Akari Minami, an undergraduate from Kyushu University who assisted with data collection and simulation during March 2019.

\item \textbf{Revise \gls{CCS} structure:} Simplified \gls{CCS} needs to be implemented that emits only 5-10\% of the CO$_2$ that the corresponding fossil fuel technology emits \cite{kato_energy_2016}. In the model, this should look like any other fossil fuel electricity generation process, except it should be more expensive and have reduced emissions. Such an implementation should \textbf{not} include retrofitting of \gls{CCS} (i.e. adding carbon capture to previously deployed fossil fuel capacity - discussed below). While we do not have Japan-specific data for \gls{CCS}, we can simplify our model by using data from the US and do one of the following:
\begin{itemize}

\item Neglect the difference between Japan and the US, assuming that the government will foot the bill of setting up the \gls{CCS} shipping network and offshore storage sites.

\item Roughly increase the cost by a small percentage, since the Japanese \gls{CCS} shipping network and offshore storage sites will be more expensive.

\item Attempt to conduct a rough ab-initio analysis by finding the cost of offshore-drilling to the depths necessary for CO$_2$ storage, the cost of pressurizing 1 ton of CO$_2$, and the cost of transporting a ton of cargo to offshore storage sites by ship.

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Revise nuclear costs:} Current models include the ideal cost of nuclear, but actual costs are often higher due to delays in construction. This is accurately reflected in data from \gls{EIA}, which already exists in our \href{https://github.com/arfc/i2cner/tree/master/data/japan_costs/fossil-ccs-nuc.xlsx}{repository}. This needs to be incorporated into our models to reduce over-deployment of nuclear.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Desired Goals}
These targets are not urgent but are strongly recommended for improving our results.

\begin{itemize}

\item Make electricity demand process more realistic:

\begin{itemize}
\item At the very least, demand should increase at +1.7 \% per year until 2030 as per \gls{METI} projections \cite{noauthor_electricity_2017}, and should plateau afterwards until 2100.

\item More accurate data for 2030-2050 should be sought to further improve upon this, if possible.

\end{itemize}

\item Cost Analysis - Some metric to compare the transition costs for each scenario should be calculated. For example, the \gls{LCoE}for each scenario for different years (say 2030,2050,2100) could be calculated, or the total cost of the transition (investment+generation) could be juxtaposed for each scenario.

\item Incorporate more \gls{I$^2$CNER} technology, such as perovskite solar cells, fuel cells for storage etc.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stretch Goals}
At this time, these targets are neither urgent nor necessary.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Implement \gls{CCS} retrofitting:} The modelling process for this is somewhat complicated. One would have to track CO$_2$ emitted from different fossil fuels separately by creating \gls{TIMES}  CO$_2$ commodities for coal, oil and petroleum. Next, the process that converts this CO$_2$ to captured CO$_2$ and atmospheric CO$_2$ would need to be defined. The total amount of CO$_2$ captured may not be greater than the total capacity of the reservoirs around Japan \cite{kato_energy_2016}.\\
The data for retrofitting in Japan is not easily available. Generic \gls{CCS} data from other countries may be used if necessary.\\

\item \textbf{Sensitivity analysis:} To identify optimum thresholds for costs or parameters (like efficiency) of novel technologies, especially \gls{I$^2$CNER} technology, to maximize their efficacy and penetration.

\end{itemize}
