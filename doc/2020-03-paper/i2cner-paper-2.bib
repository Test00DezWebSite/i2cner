	abstract = {This study assesses Japan’s mid-century low-emission pathways using both national and global integrated assessment models in the common mitigation scenario framework, based on the carbon budgets corresponding to the global 2 °C goal. We examine high and low budgets, equal to global cumulative 1600 and 1000 Gt-CO2 (2011–2100) for global models, and 36 and 31 Gt-CO2 (2011–2050) in Japan for national models, based on the cost-effectiveness allocation performed by the global models. The impacts of near-term policy assumption, including the implementation and enhancement of the 2030 target of the nationally determined contribution (NDC), are also considered. Our estimates show that the low budget scenarios require a 75\% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050 below the 2010 level, which is nearly the same as Japan’s governmental 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80\%. With regard to near-term actions, Japan’s 2030 target included in the NDC is on track to meet the high budget scenario, whereas it is falling short for the low budget scenario, which would require emission reductions immediately after 2020. Whereas models differ in the type of energy source on which they foresee Japan basing its decarbonization process (e.g., nuclear- or variable renewable energy-dependent), the large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy (nuclear, renewable, and carbon capture and storage) is shared across most models in both the high and low budget scenarios. By 2050, low-carbon energy represents 44–54\% of primary energy and 86–97\% of electricity supply in the high and low budget scenarios, respectively.},

	abstract = {"October 2018"--Cover. With the Basic Hydrogen Strategy released on December 26, 2017, Japan reiterated its commitment to pioneer the world's first "Hydrogen Society". The Strategy primarily aims to achieve the cost parity of hydrogen with competing fuels, such as gasoline in transport and Liquified Natural Gas in power generation. Japan's Strategy rests on the firm belief that hydrogen can be a decisive response to its energy and climate challenges. It could foster deep decarbonisation of the transport, power, industry and residential sectors while strengthening energy security. As such, it is a holistic, multi-sector strategy aimed to establish an integrated hydrogen economy. The Strategy encompasses the entire supply chain from production to downstream market applications. Success will primarily depend on the cost competitiveness and availability of carbon-free hydrogen fuel. Japan's state-backed approach is ambitious, as it involves domestic and overseas industry and government stakeholders on a number of cross-sectoral pilot projects. Japan's Strategy has global implications, including the potential to trigger a new area of international energy trade and industrial cooperation. Introduction.

	abstract = {In this paper, the significance of CO2-free hydrogen is discussed using a long-term global energy system. The energy demand–supply system including CO2-free hydrogen was assumed, though there are still large uncertainties as to whether a global CO2-free hydrogen energy system will be deployed. System analysis was conducted using the global and long-term intertemporal optimization energy model GRAPE under severe CO2 emission constraints. Applied global CO2 constraints for 2050 were a 50\% reduction from 1990 levels. CO2 constraints accounting for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in each region were also considered. A variety of energy resources and technologies were considered in this model. Hydrogen can be produced from low-grade coal or natural gas with CO2 capture and electricity from renewable energy. The hydrogen CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) price for Japan was about 3.2 cents/MJ in 2030. Hydrogen demand technologies considered in this paper are hydrogen-fired power plants, direct combustion, combined heat and power (fuel cells, gas engines, and gas turbines), fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. The majority of CO2-free hydrogen was deployed in the transportation sector. CO2-free hydrogen was utilized in the power sector, where deployment of other zero emission technology has some constraints. From an economic viewpoint, CO2-free hydrogen can reduce the global energy system cost. From the viewpoint of a localized region, such as Japan, deployment of CO2-free hydrogen can improve energy security and environmental indicators.},

Model analyses show that large potential reductions can be achieved at low cost in developing countries and power sectors. In addition, cost-efficient emission reductions were evaluated for some international emission reduction targets that have been derived on the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities among developed and developing countries. If (1) emission reduction measures at negative costs and below 50/tCO2 for developed countries, (2) intensity improvement measures for selected sectors at negative costs and below 20/tCO2 for major developing countries, and (3) all emission reduction measures with negative costs for other developing countries in 2020 are adopted, then emission reductions of 8.9, 14.8, and 27.7GtCO2eq./yr compared to the technology-frozen case can be expected in developed countries, major developing countries, and globally, corresponding to a 11\% decrease, 40\% increase, and 17\% increase from 2005 levels, respectively.

	abstract = {The successful development of hydrogen-energy technologies has several advantages and benefits. Hydrogen-energy development could prevent global warming as well as ensure energy security for countries without adequate energy resources. The successful development of hydrogen would provide energy for transportation and electric power. It is a unique energy carrier, as it can be produced from various energy sources such as wind, fossil fuels and biomass and, when it is combusted, it emits no CO2 emissions. The other advantage is the wide distribution of resources globally that can be used to produce hydrogen. In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published a 'Strategic Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells' in 2014, with a revised update published in March 2016. The goal of the roadmap is to achieve a hydrogen society. The roadmap aims to resolve technical problems and secure economic efficiency. The roadmap has been organized into the following three phases: Phase 1 - Installation of fuel cells; Phase 2 - Hydrogen power plant/mass supply chain; Phase 3 - CO2-free hydrogen. This paper reports on the current status of fuel cells and fuel-cell vehicles in Japan and gives a description and status of the R\&D programmes along with the results of global energy model study towards 2050.},

One of the key policy issues in Japan's energy and environmental policy arena is the energy system transition to achieve 80\% emissions reduction in 2050, a current policy goal set in 2016. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate, this paper focuses on energy-related CO2 emissions and analyzes such decarbonization scenarios that are consistent with the government goals. We employ six energy-economic and integrated assessment models to reveal decarbonization challenges in the energy system. The modeling results show that Japan's mitigation scenarios are characterized by high marginal costs of abatement. They also suggest that the industrial sector is likely to have a large final energy share and significant residual emissions under the 80\% reduction scenario, though it is generally thought that the transport sector would have large decarbonization challenges. The present findings imply that not only energy policy but also industrial policy may be relevant to the long-term environmental target. Given the high marginal costs exceeding those of negative emissions technologies that could place a cost ceiling, further model development would be crucial.},

In this study, impact of the low emission vehicles is assessed using AIM/Enduse model with 10 regions in Japan. The model is revised to integrate power generation sector and to separate the transportation demand into small, medium and large size vehicles in order to reflect the availability of BEV and fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in each vehicle size. In the Reference case, hybrid vehicle accounts for more than a half of transport demand in 2050. However, by introducing the carbon tax to achieve the 2 degree target, the share of both BEV and FCEV in 2050 reaches around 90\% and 60\% in passenger and freight transport, respectively. In addition, electricity demand pattern is transformed by demand side management in 2050 while integrating more intermittent renewable energy into electricity system. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport sector in 2050 decreases by approximately 81\% compared to the 1990 level.},

	abstract = {A common sustainability issue, arising in production systems, is the efficient use of resources for providing goods or services. With the increased interest in a hydrogen (H2) economy, the life-cycle environmental performance of H2 production has special significance for assisting in identifying opportunities to improve environmental performance and to guide challenging decisions and select between technology paths. Life cycle impact assessment methods are rapidly evolving to analyze multiple environmental impacts of the production of products or processes. This study marks the first step in developing process-based streamlined life cycle analysis (LCA) of several H2 production pathways combining life cycle impacts at the midpoint (17 problem-oriented) and endpoint (3 damage-oriented) levels using the state-of-the-art impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016. Steam reforming of natural gas, coal gasification, water electrolysis via proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM), solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), biomass gasification and reforming, and dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass were analyzed. An innovative aspect is developed in this study is an analysis of water consumption associated with H2 production pathways by life-cycle stage to provide a better understanding of the life cycle water-related impacts on human health and natural environment. For water-related scope, Water scarcity footprint (WSF) quantified using Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method was applied as a stand-alone indicator. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each production pathway, identify the drivers of environmental impact, quantify midpoint environmental impact and its influence on the endpoint environmental performance. The findings of this study could serve as a useful theoretical reference and practical basis to decision-makers of potential environmental impacts of H2 production systems.},

	abstract = {This study discusses the potential of H2 production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis as an effective option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the hydrogen sector. To address this topic, a life cycle assessment is conducted to compare proton exchange membrane water electrolysis versus the reference process - steam methane reforming. As a relevant result we show that hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions of the hydrogen sector by up to 75\%, if the electrolysis system runs exclusively on electricity generated from renewable energy sources. In a future (2050) base-load operation mode emissions are comparable to the reference system. The results for the global warming potential show a strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The thoroughly and in-depth modeled components of the electrolyser have negligible influence on impact categories; thus, emissions are mainly determined by the electricity mix. With 2017 electricity mix of Germany, the global warming potential corresponds to 29.5 kg CO2 eq. for each kg of produced hydrogen. Referring to the electricity mix we received from an energy model emissions can be reduced to 11.5 kg CO2 eq. in base-load operation by the year 2050. Using only the 3000 h of excess power from renewables in a year will allow for the reduction of the global warming potential to 3.3 kg CO2 eq. From this result we see that an environmentally friendly electricity mix is crucial for reducing the global warming impact of electrolytic hydrogen.},

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis of perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules is presented, outlining the most viable pathway for designing cost-effective, commercially viable tandems. We explore the cost-performance trade-off for silicon bottom cells in perovskite-silicon tandems, and evaluate the potential of using low-cost, lower-efficiency silicon bottom cells, on the basis of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), compared to the higher-efficiency, higher-cost bottom cells that have been the primary focus of most perovskite-silicon tandem research efforts. We fabricate a cost-effective four-terminal silicon-perovskite tandem using a low-cost multicrystalline bottom cell and calculate the device LCOE. We then extend this analysis by modeling performance and LCOE of similar tandems instead using high-efficiency silicon bottom cells, enabling direct comparison of a low-cost and a high-efficiency tandem. Lastly parametric analyses are performed to more broadly examine the bottom-cell cost-performance trade-off. We show that low-cost silicon, even at the detriment of efficiency, is the more likely path to make perovskite-silicon tandems commercially viable and enable future reductions in LCOE, given both current and near-future silicon technology. We lay out a clear economic motivation for pursuing low-cost silicon bottom cells in perovskite-silicon tandems, showing that they can achieve a 15-20\% relative LCOE reduction compared to the single-junction sub-cells. This is a 2-3 times greater relative LCOE reduction compared with using high-efficiency silicon. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of using low-cost silicon bottom cells is robust to and benefits from expected market trends, such as falling system costs and advanced, low-cost manufacturing. This work provides a clear pathway to cost-effective tandems, outlines the benefits for existing multicrystalline silicon manufacturers to investing in tandem development, and points out a clear mismatch between commercial viability and current research efforts.},

However, decision makers have the challenge of understanding the real environmental consequences of producing fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) compared to alternative green cars, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). and more conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). In this work, we presented a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of a FCV focused on its manufacturing phase and compared with the production of a BEV and an ICEV. For the manufacturing phase, the FCV inventories started from the catalyst layer to the glider, including the hydrogen tank. A sensitivity analysis on some of the key components of the fuel cell stack and the FC system (such as balance-of-plant and hydrogen tank) was carried out to account for different assumptions on materials and inventory models. The production process of the fuel cell vehicle showed a higher environmental impact compared to the production of the other two vehicles power sources. This is mainly due to the hydrogen tank and the fuel cell stack. However, by combining the results of the sensitivity analysis for each component - a best-case scenario showed that there is the potential for a 25\% reduction in the climate change impact category for the FCV compared to a baseline FCV scenario. Reducing the environmental impact associated with the manufacture of fuel cell vehicles represents an important challenge. The entire life cycle has also been considered and the manufacturing, use and disposal of FCV, electric vehicle and conventional diesel vehicle were compared. Overall, the ICEV showed the highest GWP and this was mainly due to the use phase and the fossil carbon emissions associated to the use of diesel.},

	abstract = {The production and end-of-life (EoL) processes for current and future proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for road passenger vehicle applications were analysed and quantified in the form of life cycle inventories. The current PEMFC technology is characterised by highly sensitive operating conditions and a high system mass. For each core component of PEMFC there are a range of materials under development and the research aimed to identify those considered realistic for a 2020 future scenario and according to commercial goals of achieving higher performance, increased power density, greater stability and a marked reduction of costs. End-of-life scenarios were developed in consideration of the materials at the focus of recovery efforts. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) addressed the production and EoL of the fuel cell systems with inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to assess influences on the results from the key fuel cell parameters. The second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources. However, even such "clean" hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle perspective within the time frame considered.},

	abstract = {This paper presents average values of levelized costs for generating technologies entering service in 2018, 2022, 1 and 2040 as represented in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) for the Annual Energy Outlook 2016 (AEO2016) Reference case. 2 The levelized costs for generating technologies entering service in 2022 are presented in the body of the report, with those for 2018 3 and 2040 included in Appendices A and B, respectively. Both a capacity-weighted average based on projected capacity additions across the 22 U.S. regions of the NEMS electricity market module and a simple average of the regional values are provided, together with the range of regional values. Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and its limitations Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competiveness of different generating technologies. It represents the per-kilowatthour cost (in real dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle. Key inputs to calculating LCOE include capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance (O\&M) costs, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type. 4 The importance of the factors varies among the technologies. For technologies such as solar and wind generation that have no fuel costs and relatively small variable O\&M costs, LCOE changes in rough proportion to the estimated capital cost of generation capacity. For technologies with significant fuel cost, both fuel cost and overnight cost estimates significantly affect LCOE. The availability of various incentives, including state or federal tax credits, can also impact the calculation of LCOE. As with any projection, there is uncertainty about all of these factors and their values can vary regionally and across time as technologies evolve and fuel prices change. It is important to note that actual plant investment decisions are affected by the specific technological and regional characteristics of a project, which involve numerous other factors not reflected in LCOE values. The projected utilization rate, which depends on the load shape and the existing resource mix in an area where additional capacity is needed, is one such factor. The existing resource mix in a region can directly impact the economic viability of a new investment through its effect on the economics},

	abstract = {This study investigates the stringency of Japan's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030 (nationally determined contribution: NDC), focusing on the macroeconomic assumptions of Kaya indicators and others previously overlooked, e.g. GDP per working-age population. It also conducts a decomposition analysis in light of historic political and economic events. We find that the real GDP growth assumption underlying the NDC target is unrealistic. Namely, the real GDP per working-age population, which is an indicator of productivity, needs to be improved annually by 2.5\% on average for 15 years, a high level that has not been observed since the collapse of the economic bubble in the early 1990s. Based on these findings and the data from mitigation scenarios, we conclude that Japan can achieve the NDC target (26\% below 2013 levels by 2030) with existing mitigation measures and by resuming operations only at those nuclear power plants that come under the conformity assessment, assuming realistic GDP assumptions. If the government enhances mitigation measures promoting low-carbon technologies that are politically affordable in terms of costs with realistic GDP assumptions, then it would be possible to achieve 27–42\% of GHG emissions reduction compared to the 2013 level, including the “no nuclear” scenarios.},

	abstract = { Japan's GHG emissions per gross domestic product (GDP) are 0.29 kg-CO2eq./U.S. dollar in 2013 and per capita are 11t-CO2eq./person in 2013, while the energy efficiency of the country as a whole (primary energy supply/GDP) is 95 t of oil equivalent/U.S. million dollars in 2013, all of which are already at the leading level among developed countries.  While it is generally analyzed that the marginal cost of reducing GHG emissions is high in Japan due, inter alia, to the measures taken so far, the indicators noted above are projected to improve by around 20 to 40\% by 2030 with further measures to reduce emissions.  Japan's INDC is highly transparent and concrete, as it has been drawn up by accumulating concrete policies and measures for major sectors with clear breakdowns. Each Party's submission and sharing of information on each sector in this manner would contribute to improving transparency, ensuring fairness, and also enabling effective reviews. This would promote sector-by-sector actions, which would lead to fair and efficient reductions of global emissions.  For example, with regard to Japan's industrial sectors, both steel (converter steel production) and cement (clinker production) have attained the world's highest level of energy efficiency, but further improvement is planned through specific policies and measures listed in the attached documents, such as promotion and enhancement of the industries' action plans towards a low carbon society. Contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2  Towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, in order to hold the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, it is indispensable to take measures for long-term emission reductions globally. Japan's INDC is consistent with the long-term emission pathways up to 2050 to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius goal as presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and with the goal the country upholds, namely, " the goal of achieving at least a 50\% reduction of global GHG emissions by 2050, and as a part of this, the goal of developed countries reducing GHG emissions in aggregate by 80\% or more by 2050 " . Japan will contribute proactively to these long-term reductions, through its GHG emission reduction measures presented in its INDC, and through actions that will be continuously taken into the future such as development and diffusion of low-carbon technologies and transition to a low-carbon socio-economic structure.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors developed an Optimal Power Generation Mix model, which takes into account the supply chain of imported and domestically produced hydrogen, also modeling the intermittency of renewable energy at a 10-min resolution, and applied it to the case of Japan, to investigate quantitatively the possibility of achieving zero emission in 2050. Even if the costs of wind and solar PV decline drastically towards 2050 and the huge potentials that have been assumed in the literature are realized, the total system costs escalate significantly with very high shares of intermittent renewables. Since the use of hydrogen produced by excess electricity from renewable power generation sources can only make a slight contribution to reducing this escalation, it would be invaluable to introduce at least a significant amount of electricity generated by “zero-emission thermal power” technologies, including CO2-free imported hydrogen or conventional thermal power generation with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Nuclear power is also estimated as being effective in reducing the cost hike associated with achieving zero emissions. The results of this study could contribute to giving insights regarding global deployment of hydrogen-related technologies, as well as to presenting a frame of reference for Japan's future energy policies.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study is to analyze feasibility and a roadmap of a low-carbon society in Japan by 2050, while satisfying required demands. Future technology roadmaps, CO 2 emission pathways and energy mix transitions leading Japan are calculated using the AIM/Backcasting Model based on backcasting methodology with taking into consideration that one of the keys for technological market penetration is the preferences of consumers. Under the CO 2 emission target of 80\% reduction as compared to 1990 level by 2050, it is found from the results that the target is feasible in Japan by implementing actions toward low-carbon society as early as possible. From the perspective of minimizing the total costs, it would be best to target a reduction rate of 16-20\% in 2020, 31-35\% in 2030 and 53-56\% in 2040 within the range of Scenarios A and B. During this process, major investment will be needed in the early stage of the analytical periods, especially in the residential, commercial and transport sectors. However, viewed in the long term, this can be recovered by reduction in energy consumption. Moreover, the analysis suggests that returns that balance the total investment may be possible. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Water reacting with high temperature fuel metal covering resulted in hydrogen generation and hydrogen explosion of reactor buildings. This accident caused radioactive release to the environment. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to understand in detail the mechanism of the accident progression for Units 1–3 that were in operation by utilizing results of computer simulations. It should be noted that, due to limited information and capability of the state-of-the-art severe-accident simulation tools, there are still unanswered questions, which should be tackled by academic research for improving and enhancing safety for the nuclear industry now and in the future.},

The aims of this research focus on the potential quantification and sensitivity assessment of power to hydrogen, based on the history of electricity load and generation in Kyushu. First, a simulation model was developed considering detailed technical constraints. Results indicated that increasing grid-tied renewable production raised the increasing flexibility requirement and LACE of mixed renewable energy, curtailment presented variations across months, and the optimal combination of solar and wind generation could decrease curtailment. Then the technical-economic performance of renewable energy to hydrogen production was estimated under different scenarios and assumptions. The capacity and full-load operating period were quantified based on the sorted surplus renewable descending curves. Potential and investment scenarios of the proposed P2G approach highly depended on the structure of the combined solar and wind resources, converting efficiency and H2 price. Gross renewable production was fixed to an annual grid load ratio of 40\%. Implementation of optimal large-scale electrolyzer raises the effective utilisation ratio of renewable production from 59.1\% to 74.3\%. 57.5\% of the surplus renewable generation was converted into hydrogen to decarbonize the social energy supply system.},

The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese MARKAL/TIMES framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process. Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable. The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns.},

This study evaluates the role of hydrogen in future energy systems in Japan using a MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model. A range of uncertainties are considered for nuclear power generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) from fossil power generation. Our results suggest that an 80\% reduction of CO2 emissions from the 2013 level by 2050 requires emissions from the electricity sector to decrease to nearly zero. Hydrogen power must play a functional role in future energy systems in Japan, but its contribution should depend on nuclear power and CCS.},
