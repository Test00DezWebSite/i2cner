\subsection{TIMES Model Description}
The \gls{TIMES} model generator is designed to model dynamic energy systems and simulate transition scenarios as a mixed-integer programming linear optimization problem that is subject to a primary objective function and additional constraints. The generation, trade, refinement, storage, and supply of energy commodities across multiple sectors and multiple regions is modeled using a wide variety of in-built commodity and process types. Emissions can be associated with energy commodities or processes as emission coefficient per unit commodity produced or consumed. 

The objective function in our simulations is the overall cost of the transition. The major constrains in our simulations are the demand for electricity (see table \ref{demand}), emission constraints based on Japan's \gls{INDC} (see table \ref{co2-limits}), and feasible nameplate capacity deployment limits (see table \ref{caplim}). Hence each simulation is focused on minimizing the transition cost while attempting to meet the increasing electricity demand and achieving the required emission cuts using, a combination of technologies of various readiness levels. 

While electricity demand in the near term is expected to grow, long term electricity demand is expected to plateau, or even decrease, due to Japan's aging population. However, precisely quantifying this rate of decrease is challenging as there is potential for increased electrification of  transportation and industrial sectors. Hence, post-2030, we have assumed a demand curve based on the likelihood of increased electrification resulting in increasing demand for electricity, but the demand eventually plateaus due to the aging population. The unique initial condition of the post-Fukushima Japanese electricity supply system is captured using \gls{EDMC} data from 2013-2016. Long term impacts of factors such as the retirement of the existing nuclear fleet and the new deployment of emerging, potentially disruptive technology is assessed by simulating the system until 2100. The carbon cost of each technology is accounted for using an emission coefficient that incorporates both direct emissions and life cycle emissions (averaged over the entire lifetime output) for every technology, as applicable. The daily and seasonal variability of renewables is incorporated using day-night and seasonal time periods. The availability of renewables varies during these time periods (for instance, solar output drops to zero at night, and a similar notion of days without wind is incorporated) based on the annually averaged capacity factors of renewables in Japan (cite).

To explore possible pathways to curbing \gls{GHG} emissions, we simulated different transition scenarios with different combinations of technologies enabled for deployment. The first set of technologies includes conventional technologies such as  \gls{USC},\gls{lng}, solar photovoltaic, wind energy (with onshore, offshore-fixed and offshore-floating considered separately) and utility-scale lithium-ion battery storage. New deployments of oil-fuelled power plants are not considered due to the declining use of oil for electricity generation in Japan, as it is contrary to Japan's goal of energy security and independence as per the Basic Energy Plan. The second set of technologies considered includes emerging carbon-neutral technologies that are already commercialized or close to commercialization, namely emerging solar photovoltaic (representative of technologies such as perovskites, CdTe),\gls{CCS} and utility-scale hydrogen power. For hydrogen power, steam reforming, steam reforming with \gls{CCS}, \gls{AEC},\gls{PEMEC},\gls{PEMFC}, and \gls{SOFC} were selected for simulation based on their technological. Along with these two technology groups, it is also important to consider the impact of nuclear energy as it has extremely low life-cycle emissions and a high capacity factor,thereby being more reliable than renewables. However, nuclear power faces extremely low public acceptance in Japan after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, and its future in Japan is highly uncertain. Hence, scenarios where new nuclear reactor deployment is enabled and disabled must be juxtaposed to assess the potential role of nuclear in decarbonization of the electricity generation sector. Finally, the long-term impact of nascent hydrogen technologies on the hydrogen economy is assessed in an additional scenario. In this scenario, the potential commercialization of \gls{SOEC} and \gls{PWS} post-2050 is explored. Thus, five scenarios are simulated to explore possible transition pathways under a wide variety of conditions, and these are detailed in table \ref{scen-table}.

The economic data, emission coefficients, nameplate capacity limits and growth rates incorporated in the model are detailed in tables \ref{eco}, \ref{caplim}, and \ref{growrate} respectively. Learning curves for costs and life-cycle emissions are compiled from existing data about cost projections, scale-up of manufacturing, availability of manufacturing materials (especially rare earth materials) and the use of clean energy for manufacturing. These learning curves modelled as linear functions interpolated between the data values used, with the curve plateauing at the latest value for said parameter, as detailed in table \ref{eco}. Capacity limits on renewables and \gls{PWS} are based on their land-use requirements, whereas the assumed capacity limits for nuclear are based on the minimum requirement for nuclear in different scenarios. The land use footprint of other technologies is considered negligible. Maximum annual capacity growth rates for existing technologies are constant. The growth rate of nuclear power based on historic trends and current pressure vessel manufacturing limitations. The reactor size assumed in this study is 1165 MWe. The growth rates of all emerging technologies are modeled on the growth rates observed for solar photovoltaic technology, with rapid initial growth plateauing at a moderate maximum growth rate. One notable exception is the maximum growth rate of emerging solar technologies, which we have assumed to be the same as that of existing solar photovoltaic technologies. We believe that these technologies, some of which are already commercialized or close to commercialization,  will benefit immensely from the already streamlined solar photovoltaic manufacturing and supply chain. Hence they could be deployed as rapidly as solar photovoltaic. 

All lithium ion storage has an energy-to-power ratio of 4 (cite NREL), a discharge time of 4h, and an availability factor of about 96\%(based on 3500 lifetime cycles over 10 years). Our assumptions about the reduction in the investment costs of life-cycle emissions are conservative due to the rising cost of cobalt and nickel and the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries in high \gls{GHG} emission countries. All hydrogen storage devices are operated with a maximum availability factor of 90\%, making them extremely flexible for load following. Long-term storage of hydrogen is also available using hydrogen tanks with appropriate losses (cite IEA). For hydrogen electrolyzers and fuel cells, life-cycle emissions from just the stack are considered, as \gls{BOP} emissions from utility scale hydrogen depend strongly on the nature of the hydrogen facility and the source of energy used for electrolysis (eg: wind, biomass, solar photovoltaic etc.)
