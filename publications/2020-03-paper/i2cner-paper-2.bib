	abstract = {This study assesses Japan’s mid-century low-emission pathways using both national and global integrated assessment models in the common mitigation scenario framework, based on the carbon budgets corresponding to the global 2 °C goal. We examine high and low budgets, equal to global cumulative 1600 and 1000 Gt-CO2 (2011–2100) for global models, and 36 and 31 Gt-CO2 (2011–2050) in Japan for national models, based on the cost-effectiveness allocation performed by the global models. The impacts of near-term policy assumption, including the implementation and enhancement of the 2030 target of the nationally determined contribution (NDC), are also considered. Our estimates show that the low budget scenarios require a 75\% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2050 below the 2010 level, which is nearly the same as Japan’s governmental 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80\%. With regard to near-term actions, Japan’s 2030 target included in the NDC is on track to meet the high budget scenario, whereas it is falling short for the low budget scenario, which would require emission reductions immediately after 2020. Whereas models differ in the type of energy source on which they foresee Japan basing its decarbonization process (e.g., nuclear- or variable renewable energy-dependent), the large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy (nuclear, renewable, and carbon capture and storage) is shared across most models in both the high and low budget scenarios. By 2050, low-carbon energy represents 44–54\% of primary energy and 86–97\% of electricity supply in the high and low budget scenarios, respectively.},

	abstract = {"October 2018"--Cover. With the Basic Hydrogen Strategy released on December 26, 2017, Japan reiterated its commitment to pioneer the world's first "Hydrogen Society". The Strategy primarily aims to achieve the cost parity of hydrogen with competing fuels, such as gasoline in transport and Liquified Natural Gas in power generation. Japan's Strategy rests on the firm belief that hydrogen can be a decisive response to its energy and climate challenges. It could foster deep decarbonisation of the transport, power, industry and residential sectors while strengthening energy security. As such, it is a holistic, multi-sector strategy aimed to establish an integrated hydrogen economy. The Strategy encompasses the entire supply chain from production to downstream market applications. Success will primarily depend on the cost competitiveness and availability of carbon-free hydrogen fuel. Japan's state-backed approach is ambitious, as it involves domestic and overseas industry and government stakeholders on a number of cross-sectoral pilot projects. Japan's Strategy has global implications, including the potential to trigger a new area of international energy trade and industrial cooperation. Introduction.

The energy demand–supply system including CO2-free hydrogen was assumed, though there are still large uncertainties as to whether a global CO2-free hydrogen energy system will be deployed. System analysis was conducted using the global and long-term intertemporal optimization energy model GRAPE under severe CO2 emission constraints. Applied global CO2 constraints for 2050 were a 50\% reduction from 1990 levels. CO2 constraints accounting for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in each region were also considered. A variety of energy resources and technologies were considered in this model. Hydrogen can be produced from low-grade coal or natural gas with CO2 capture and electricity from renewable energy. The hydrogen CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) price for Japan was about 3.2 cents/MJ in 2030. Hydrogen demand technologies considered in this paper are hydrogen-fired power plants, direct combustion, combined heat and power (fuel cells, gas engines, and gas turbines), fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. The majority of CO2-free hydrogen was deployed in the transportation sector. CO2-free hydrogen was utilized in the power sector, where deployment of other zero emission technology has some constraints. From an economic viewpoint, CO2-free hydrogen can reduce the global energy system cost. From the viewpoint of a localized region, such as Japan, deployment of CO2-free hydrogen can improve energy security and environmental indicators.},

Model analyses show that large potential reductions can be achieved at low cost in developing countries and power sectors. In addition, cost-efficient emission reductions were evaluated for some international emission reduction targets that have been derived on the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities among developed and developing countries. If (1) emission reduction measures at negative costs and below 50/tCO2 for developed countries, (2) intensity improvement measures for selected sectors at negative costs and below 20/tCO2 for major developing countries, and (3) all emission reduction measures with negative costs for other developing countries in 2020 are adopted, then emission reductions of 8.9, 14.8, and 27.7GtCO2eq./yr compared to the technology-frozen case can be expected in developed countries, major developing countries, and globally, corresponding to a 11\% decrease, 40\% increase, and 17\% increase from 2005 levels, respectively.

	abstract = {The successful development of hydrogen-energy technologies has several advantages and benefits. Hydrogen-energy development could prevent global warming as well as ensure energy security for countries without adequate energy resources. The successful development of hydrogen would provide energy for transportation and electric power. It is a unique energy carrier, as it can be produced from various energy sources such as wind, fossil fuels and biomass and, when it is combusted, it emits no CO2 emissions. The other advantage is the wide distribution of resources globally that can be used to produce hydrogen. In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published a 'Strategic Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells' in 2014, with a revised update published in March 2016. The goal of the roadmap is to achieve a hydrogen society. The roadmap aims to resolve technical problems and secure economic efficiency. The roadmap has been organized into the following three phases: Phase 1 - Installation of fuel cells; Phase 2 - Hydrogen power plant/mass supply chain; Phase 3 - CO2-free hydrogen. This paper reports on the current status of fuel cells and fuel-cell vehicles in Japan and gives a description and status of the R\&D programmes along with the results of global energy model study towards 2050.},

One of the key policy issues in Japan's energy and environmental policy arena is the energy system transition to achieve 80\% emissions reduction in 2050, a current policy goal set in 2016. To contribute to the ongoing policy debate, this paper focuses on energy-related CO2 emissions and analyzes such decarbonization scenarios that are consistent with the government goals. We employ six energy-economic and integrated assessment models to reveal decarbonization challenges in the energy system. The modeling results show that Japan's mitigation scenarios are characterized by high marginal costs of abatement. They also suggest that the industrial sector is likely to have a large final energy share and significant residual emissions under the 80\% reduction scenario, though it is generally thought that the transport sector would have large decarbonization challenges. The present findings imply that not only energy policy but also industrial policy may be relevant to the long-term environmental target. Given the high marginal costs exceeding those of negative emissions technologies that could place a cost ceiling, further model development would be crucial.},

In this study, impact of the low emission vehicles is assessed using AIM/Enduse model with 10 regions in Japan. The model is revised to integrate power generation sector and to separate the transportation demand into small, medium and large size vehicles in order to reflect the availability of BEV and fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in each vehicle size. In the Reference case, hybrid vehicle accounts for more than a half of transport demand in 2050. However, by introducing the carbon tax to achieve the 2 degree target, the share of both BEV and FCEV in 2050 reaches around 90\% and 60\% in passenger and freight transport, respectively. In addition, electricity demand pattern is transformed by demand side management in 2050 while integrating more intermittent renewable energy into electricity system. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport sector in 2050 decreases by approximately 81\% compared to the 1990 level.},

	abstract = {A techno-economic analysis of perovskite-silicon tandem solar modules is presented, outlining the most viable pathway for designing cost-effective, commercially viable tandems. We explore the cost-performance trade-off for silicon bottom cells in perovskite-silicon tandems, and evaluate the potential of using low-cost, lower-efficiency silicon bottom cells, on the basis of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), compared to the higher-efficiency, higher-cost bottom cells that have been the primary focus of most perovskite-silicon tandem research efforts. We fabricate a cost-effective four-terminal silicon-perovskite tandem using a low-cost multicrystalline bottom cell and calculate the device LCOE. We then extend this analysis by modeling performance and LCOE of similar tandems instead using high-efficiency silicon bottom cells, enabling direct comparison of a low-cost and a high-efficiency tandem. Lastly parametric analyses are performed to more broadly examine the bottom-cell cost-performance trade-off. We show that low-cost silicon, even at the detriment of efficiency, is the more likely path to make perovskite-silicon tandems commercially viable and enable future reductions in LCOE, given both current and near-future silicon technology. We lay out a clear economic motivation for pursuing low-cost silicon bottom cells in perovskite-silicon tandems, showing that they can achieve a 15-20\% relative LCOE reduction compared to the single-junction sub-cells. This is a 2-3 times greater relative LCOE reduction compared with using high-efficiency silicon. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of using low-cost silicon bottom cells is robust to and benefits from expected market trends, such as falling system costs and advanced, low-cost manufacturing. This work provides a clear pathway to cost-effective tandems, outlines the benefits for existing multicrystalline silicon manufacturers to investing in tandem development, and points out a clear mismatch between commercial viability and current research efforts.},

	abstract = {In moving towards a more sustainable society, hydrogen fueled polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology is seen as a great opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the transport sector. However, decision makers have the challenge of understanding the real environmental consequences of producing fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) compared to alternative green cars, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). and more conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). In this work, we presented a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of a FCV focused on its manufacturing phase and compared with the production of a BEV and an ICEV. For the manufacturing phase, the FCV inventories started from the catalyst layer to the glider, including the hydrogen tank. A sensitivity analysis on some of the key components of the fuel cell stack and the FC system (such as balance-of-plant and hydrogen tank) was carried out to account for different assumptions on materials and inventory models. The production process of the fuel cell vehicle showed a higher environmental impact compared to the production of the other two vehicles power sources. This is mainly due to the hydrogen tank and the fuel cell stack. However, by combining the results of the sensitivity analysis for each component - a best-case scenario showed that there is the potential for a 25\% reduction in the climate change impact category for the FCV compared to a baseline FCV scenario. Reducing the environmental impact associated with the manufacture of fuel cell vehicles represents an important challenge. The entire life cycle has also been considered and the manufacturing, use and disposal of FCV, electric vehicle and conventional diesel vehicle were compared. Overall, the ICEV showed the highest GWP and this was mainly due to the use phase and the fossil carbon emissions associated to the use of diesel.},

Both a capacity-weighted average based on projected capacity additions across the 22 U.S. regions of the NEMS electricity market module and a simple average of the regional values are provided, together with the range of regional values. Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and its limitations Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competiveness of different generating technologies. It represents the per-kilowatthour cost (in real dollars) of building and operating a generating plant over an assumed financial life and duty cycle. Key inputs to calculating LCOE include capital costs, fuel costs, fixed and variable operations and maintenance (O\&M) costs, financing costs, and an assumed utilization rate for each plant type. 4 The importance of the factors varies among the technologies. For technologies such as solar and wind generation that have no fuel costs and relatively small variable O\&M costs, LCOE changes in rough proportion to the estimated capital cost of generation capacity. For technologies with significant fuel cost, both fuel cost and overnight cost estimates significantly affect LCOE. The availability of various incentives, including state or federal tax credits, can also impact the calculation of LCOE. As with any projection, there is uncertainty about all of these factors and their values can vary regionally and across time as technologies evolve and fuel prices change. It is important to note that actual plant investment decisions are affected by the specific technological and regional characteristics of a project, which involve numerous other factors not reflected in LCOE values. The projected utilization rate, which depends on the load shape and the existing resource mix in an area where additional capacity is needed, is one such factor. The existing resource mix in a region can directly impact the economic viability of a new investment through its effect on the economics},

	abstract = {This study investigates the stringency of Japan's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2030 (nationally determined contribution: NDC), focusing on the macroeconomic assumptions of Kaya indicators and others previously overlooked, e.g. GDP per working-age population. It also conducts a decomposition analysis in light of historic political and economic events. We find that the real GDP growth assumption underlying the NDC target is unrealistic. Namely, the real GDP per working-age population, which is an indicator of productivity, needs to be improved annually by 2.5\% on average for 15 years, a high level that has not been observed since the collapse of the economic bubble in the early 1990s. Based on these findings and the data from mitigation scenarios, we conclude that Japan can achieve the NDC target (26\% below 2013 levels by 2030) with existing mitigation measures and by resuming operations only at those nuclear power plants that come under the conformity assessment, assuming realistic GDP assumptions. If the government enhances mitigation measures promoting low-carbon technologies that are politically affordable in terms of costs with realistic GDP assumptions, then it would be possible to achieve 27–42\% of GHG emissions reduction compared to the 2013 level, including the “no nuclear” scenarios.},

	abstract = { Japan's GHG emissions per gross domestic product (GDP) are 0.29 kg-CO2eq./U.S. dollar in 2013 and per capita are 11t-CO2eq./person in 2013, while the energy efficiency of the country as a whole (primary energy supply/GDP) is 95 t of oil equivalent/U.S. million dollars in 2013, all of which are already at the leading level among developed countries.  While it is generally analyzed that the marginal cost of reducing GHG emissions is high in Japan due, inter alia, to the measures taken so far, the indicators noted above are projected to improve by around 20 to 40\% by 2030 with further measures to reduce emissions.  Japan's INDC is highly transparent and concrete, as it has been drawn up by accumulating concrete policies and measures for major sectors with clear breakdowns. Each Party's submission and sharing of information on each sector in this manner would contribute to improving transparency, ensuring fairness, and also enabling effective reviews. This would promote sector-by-sector actions, which would lead to fair and efficient reductions of global emissions.  For example, with regard to Japan's industrial sectors, both steel (converter steel production) and cement (clinker production) have attained the world's highest level of energy efficiency, but further improvement is planned through specific policies and measures listed in the attached documents, such as promotion and enhancement of the industries' action plans towards a low carbon society. Contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2  Towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, in order to hold the increase in global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius, it is indispensable to take measures for long-term emission reductions globally. Japan's INDC is consistent with the long-term emission pathways up to 2050 to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius goal as presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and with the goal the country upholds, namely, " the goal of achieving at least a 50\% reduction of global GHG emissions by 2050, and as a part of this, the goal of developed countries reducing GHG emissions in aggregate by 80\% or more by 2050 " . Japan will contribute proactively to these long-term reductions, through its GHG emission reduction measures presented in its INDC, and through actions that will be continuously taken into the future such as development and diffusion of low-carbon technologies and transition to a low-carbon socio-economic structure.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors developed an Optimal Power Generation Mix model, which takes into account the supply chain of imported and domestically produced hydrogen, also modeling the intermittency of renewable energy at a 10-min resolution, and applied it to the case of Japan, to investigate quantitatively the possibility of achieving zero emission in 2050. Even if the costs of wind and solar PV decline drastically towards 2050 and the huge potentials that have been assumed in the literature are realized, the total system costs escalate significantly with very high shares of intermittent renewables. Since the use of hydrogen produced by excess electricity from renewable power generation sources can only make a slight contribution to reducing this escalation, it would be invaluable to introduce at least a significant amount of electricity generated by “zero-emission thermal power” technologies, including CO2-free imported hydrogen or conventional thermal power generation with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Nuclear power is also estimated as being effective in reducing the cost hike associated with achieving zero emissions. The results of this study could contribute to giving insights regarding global deployment of hydrogen-related technologies, as well as to presenting a frame of reference for Japan's future energy policies.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the study is to analyze feasibility and a roadmap of a low-carbon society in Japan by 2050, while satisfying required demands. Future technology roadmaps, CO 2 emission pathways and energy mix transitions leading Japan are calculated using the AIM/Backcasting Model based on backcasting methodology with taking into consideration that one of the keys for technological market penetration is the preferences of consumers. Under the CO 2 emission target of 80\% reduction as compared to 1990 level by 2050, it is found from the results that the target is feasible in Japan by implementing actions toward low-carbon society as early as possible. From the perspective of minimizing the total costs, it would be best to target a reduction rate of 16-20\% in 2020, 31-35\% in 2030 and 53-56\% in 2040 within the range of Scenarios A and B. During this process, major investment will be needed in the early stage of the analytical periods, especially in the residential, commercial and transport sectors. However, viewed in the long term, this can be recovered by reduction in energy consumption. Moreover, the analysis suggests that returns that balance the total investment may be possible. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Flooding by the tsunami induced loss of AC and/or DC power for reactor cooling, hence the reactor water level decreased and fuel was exposed. Water reacting with high temperature fuel metal covering resulted in hydrogen generation and hydrogen explosion of reactor buildings. This accident caused radioactive release to the environment. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to understand in detail the mechanism of the accident progression for Units 1–3 that were in operation by utilizing results of computer simulations. It should be noted that, due to limited information and capability of the state-of-the-art severe-accident simulation tools, there are still unanswered questions, which should be tackled by academic research for improving and enhancing safety for the nuclear industry now and in the future.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production as a flexible energy carrier is expected to play a promising role in supporting recover curtailed grid-tied renewable energy. The aims of this research focus on the potential quantification and sensitivity assessment of power to hydrogen, based on the history of electricity load and generation in Kyushu. First, a simulation model was developed considering detailed technical constraints. Results indicated that increasing grid-tied renewable production raised the increasing flexibility requirement and LACE of mixed renewable energy, curtailment presented variations across months, and the optimal combination of solar and wind generation could decrease curtailment. Then the technical-economic performance of renewable energy to hydrogen production was estimated under different scenarios and assumptions. The capacity and full-load operating period were quantified based on the sorted surplus renewable descending curves. Potential and investment scenarios of the proposed P2G approach highly depended on the structure of the combined solar and wind resources, converting efficiency and H2 price. Gross renewable production was fixed to an annual grid load ratio of 40\%. Implementation of optimal large-scale electrolyzer raises the effective utilisation ratio of renewable production from 59.1\% to 74.3\%. 57.5\% of the surplus renewable generation was converted into hydrogen to decarbonize the social energy supply system.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the sustainability and social equity impacts of the ongoing transition toward a low carbon society in Japan to assess the merits of top-down and bottom-up approaches. The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese MARKAL/TIMES framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process. Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable. The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns.},

However, uncertainties remain as to the feasibility of their development and implementation. Therefore, possible scenarios for the potential of these technologies should be considered to allow for flexible decision-making with respect to long-term energy strategies in Japan. This study evaluates the role of hydrogen in future energy systems in Japan using a MARKet ALlocation (MARKAL) model. A range of uncertainties are considered for nuclear power generation and carbon capture and storage (CCS) from fossil power generation. Our results suggest that an 80\% reduction of CO2 emissions from the 2013 level by 2050 requires emissions from the electricity sector to decrease to nearly zero. Hydrogen power must play a functional role in future energy systems in Japan, but its contribution should depend on nuclear power and CCS.},

Recent papers and studies on raw material availability are relating to a narrow topic, for example, focusing only on lithium in global consideration, or take into consideration an average metal content of batteries. Present paper makes a step toward expanding information on net metal demand of battery cell active materials and metal reserves focusing on Europe, as one of the world largest economy doing large effort to become world leader in electric mobility. Five potential cell chemistries were identified based on research trends and future expectations of researcher, car and battery manufacturers. Furthermore, a potential share of battery- and electric vehicle types in hypothetical car fleet was proposed, as well. Lithium, cobalt, manganese and nickel requirement and European reserves were examined. Present study pointed out that the potential share of electric mobility in road traffic of the European Union had a detectable, but insignificant impact on global metal production and reserves. In the case of a hypothetical European production of future traction battery cells, shortage in European lithium and nickel reserves might be expectable at around 2025. Demand on cobalt and manganese are found to be far below the available European reserves.},

Using a life cycle assessment methodology we analyze the impacts of the construction, disposal/end of life, and usage of each of the systems. Pumped hydro and compressed air storage are studied as mechanical storage, and advanced lead acid, sodium sulfur, lithium-ion and nickel–sodium-chloride batteries are addressed as electrochemical storage systems. Hydrogen production from electrolysis and subsequent usage in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell are also analyzed. The selected electricity storage systems mimic real world installations in terms of capacity, power rating, life time, technology and application. The functional unit is one kWh of energy delivered back to the grid, from the storage system. The environmental impacts assessed are climate change, human toxicity, particulate matter formation, and fossil resource depletion. Different electricity mixes are used in order to exemplify scenarios where the selected technologies meet specific applications. Results indicate that the performance of the storage systems is tied to the electricity feedstocks used during use stage. Renewable energy sources have lower impacts throughout the use stage of the storage technologies. Using the Belgium electricity mix of 2011 as benchmark, the sodium sulfur battery is shown to be the best performer for all the impacts analyzed. Pumped hydro storage follows in second place. Regarding infrastructure and end of life, results indicate that battery systems have higher impacts than mechanical ones because of lower number of cycles and life time energy.},

	abstract = {Most assessments available in the literature have assumed that power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) will operate at base load. It is now becoming clear that in many cases CCS plants will need to be able to operate flexibly because of the variability of electricity demand, increased use of variable renewable energy sources and poor flexibility of other technologies such as nuclear. This paper summarizes the results of a study carried out by Foster Wheeler for the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme with the purpose of evaluating and proposing strategies for improving the operating flexibility of power plants with CCS.},

	abstract = {This study is a comparative analysis of hydrogen production costs in current and potential future market environments. The economic feasibility of hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane was compared to two other technologies, namely steam methane reforming and water electrolysis. According to the results, thermal decomposition of methane would be most suited for on-site demand-driven hydrogen production in small or medium industrial scale. Hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane would be economically competitive with steam reforming with a product carbon value of at least 280–310 EUR/tonne. By contrast, the main benefit of thermal decomposition of methane in comparison with water electrolysis is the feedstock availability via the current natural gas infrastructure, whereas electrolysis is highly dependent on the cost and availability of renewable electricity. The major factors affecting the economic feasibility were identified as product carbon value in thermal decomposition of methane, natural gas cost in steam reforming, and electricity cost in electrolysis. Thus, the effect of these variables on the hydrogen production costs was analyzed. Additionally, the specific carbon dioxide emissions in hydrogen production by thermal decomposition of methane (40 kgCO2/MWhH2) were found to be much less that by steam reforming coupled with carbon dioxide capture from the syngas (133 kgCO2/MWhH2).},

	abstract = {Solar cells are considered as one of the prominent sources of renewable energy suitable for large-scale adoption in a carbon-constrained world and can contribute to reduced reliance on energy imports, whilst improving the security of energy supply. A new arrival in the family of solar cells technologies is the organic-inorganic halide perovskite. The major thrust for endorsing these new solar cells pertains to their potential as an economically and environmentally viable option to traditional silicon-based technology. To verify this assertion, this paper presents a critical review of some existing photovoltaic (PV) technologies in comparison with perovskite-structured solar cells (PSCs), including material and performance parameters, production processes and manufacturing complexity, economics, key technological challenges for further developments and current research efforts. At present, there is limited environmental assessment of PSCs and consequently, a methodologically robust and environmentally expansive lifecycle supply chain assessment of two types of PSC modules A and B is also undertaken within the context of other PV technologies, to assess their potential for environmentally friendly innovation in the energy sector. Module A is based on MAPbX3 perovskite structure while module B is based on CsFAPbX3 with improved stability, reproducibility and high performance efficiency. The main outcomes, presented along with sensitivity analysis, show that PSCs offer more environmentally friendly and sustainable option, with the least energy payback period, as compared to other PV technologies. The review and analysis presented provide valuable insight and guidance in identifying pathways and windows of opportunity for future PV designs towards cleaner and sustainable energy production.},

	abstract = {This study discusses the potential of H2 production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis as an effective option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the hydrogen sector. To address this topic, a life cycle assessment is conducted to compare proton exchange membrane water electrolysis versus the reference process - steam methane reforming. As a relevant result we show that hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions of the hydrogen sector by up to 75\%, if the electrolysis system runs exclusively on electricity generated from renewable energy sources. In a future (2050) base-load operation mode emissions are comparable to the reference system. The results for the global warming potential show a strong reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The thoroughly and in-depth modeled components of the electrolyser have negligible influence on impact categories; thus, emissions are mainly determined by the electricity mix. With 2017 electricity mix of Germany, the global warming potential corresponds to 29.5 kg CO2 eq. for each kg of produced hydrogen. Referring to the electricity mix we received from an energy model emissions can be reduced to 11.5 kg CO2 eq. in base-load operation by the year 2050. Using only the 3000 h of excess power from renewables in a year will allow for the reduction of the global warming potential to 3.3 kg CO2 eq. From this result we see that an environmentally friendly electricity mix is crucial for reducing the global warming impact of electrolytic hydrogen.},

	title = {Boil-off losses along {LH2} pathway},
	url = {http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1466121/},
	abstract = {Losses along the LH2 pathway are intrinsic to the utilization of a cryogenic fluid. They occur when the molecule is transferred between 2 vessels (liquefaction plant to trailer, trailer to station storage, station storage to pump or compressor, then fuel cell electric vehicles …) and when the fluid is warmed up due to heat transfer with the environment. Those losses can be estimated with good accuracy using thermodynamic models based on conservation of mass and energy, providing the thermodynamic states are correctly described. Indeed, the fluid undergoes various changes as it moves along the entire pathway (2 phase transition, super-heated warming, non-uniform temperature distributions across the saturation film) and accurate equations of state and 2 phase behavior implementations are essential. The balances of mass and energy during the various dynamics processes then enable to quantify the boil-off losses. In this work, a MATLAB code previously developed by NASA to simulate rocket loading is used as the basis for the LH2 transfer model. This code implements complex physical phenomena such as the competition between condensation and evaporation and the convection vs. conduction heat transfer as a function of the relative temperatures on both sides of the saturated film. The original code was modified to consider real gas equations of state, and some semi-empirical relationships, such as between the heat of vaporization and the critical temperature, were also replaced by a REFPROP equivalent expression, assumed to be more accurate. Non-constant liquid temperature equations were added to simulate sub-cooled conditions. It is shown that although trailer depressurization and transfer losses from the receiving vessel during a LH2 delivery may constitute the largest sources of losses, those can be greatly reduced and even eliminated if CFR/DOT regulations are properly applied and if no-vent fill methods are implemented, particularly for a stationary LH2 storage operating at reasonably low pressure (45 psia or so). As such, it is expected that the only remaining boil-off losses for a refueling station would come from the LH2 pump (utilization and idling), pump vessel cool down/warm up, and environment heat transfer. Based on experimental data measured at LLNL on the Linde 875 bar LH2 cryo-pump and results from the model, and extrapolating for refueling stations of various sizes, it can be shown that boil-off losses can vary from 15\% of delivered LH2 for a 100 kg/day, 5\% at 400 kg/day, and down to less than 2\% for stations above 1,800 kg/day (for a system similar to the one at LLNL). Less boil-off is to be expected for LH2 pumps dispensing at 350 bar, so that less than 0.7\% can be expected above 1,800 kg/day station capacities. At last, boil-off recovery solutions are briefly analyzed, including compressors, cryo-coolers and stationary fuel cell. Their economic value is strongly related to the costs of H2 and of the electricity needed to perform the recovery, on top of the initial capital expenditures. Effective boil-off could be reduced to 0.6-1\% for a 2,000 kg/day station if adequate recovery solutions are used.},

Toward that end, we employed a similar methodology based on review and analysis of recent cost studies for the major CCS options identified in the SRCCS, namely, post-combustion CO2 capture at supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants, plus pre-combustion capture at coal-based integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants. We also report current costs for SCPC plants employing oxy-combustion for CO2 capture—an option that was still in the early stages of development at the time of the SRCCS. To compare current CCS cost estimates to those in the SRCCS, we adjust all costs to constant 2013 US dollars using cost indices for power plant capital costs, fuel costs and other O\&M costs. On this basis, we report changes in capital cost, levelized cost of electricity, and mitigation costs for each power plant system with and without CCS. We also discuss the outlook for future CCS costs.},

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to examine the sustainability and environmental performance of PV-based electricity generation systems by conducting a thorough review of the life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of five common photovoltaic (PV) systems, i.e., mono-crystalline (mono-Si), multi-crystalline (multi-Si), amorphous silicon (a-Si), CdTe thin film (CdTe) and CIS thin film (CIS), and some advanced PV systems. The results show that, among the five common PV systems, the CdTe PV system presents the best environmental performance in terms of energy payback time (EPBT) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission rate due to its low life-cycle energy requirement and relatively high conversion efficiency. Meanwhile, the mono-Si PV system demonstrates the worst because of its high energy intensity during the solar cells’ production process. The EPBT and GHG emission rate of thin film PV systems are within the range of 0.75–3.5 years and 10.5–50g CO2-eq./kWh, respectively. In general, the EPBT of mono-Si PV systems range from 1.7 to 2.7 years with GHG emission rate from 29 to 45g CO2-eq./kWh, which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of fossil-based electricity. This paper also reviews the EPBT and GHG emission rates of some advanced PV systems, such as high-concentration, heterojunction and dye-sensitized technologies. The EBPT of high-concentration PV system is lower, ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 years, but the CO2 emission rate of dye-sensitized PV system is higher than the ones of other PV systems at the moment. The LCA results show that PV technologies are already proved to be very sustainable and environmental-friendly in the state of the art. With the emerging of new manufacturing technologies, the environmental performance of PV technologies is expected to be further improved in the near future. In addition, considering the existing limitations in the previous LCA studies, a few suggestions are recommended.},

	abstract = {There are several hydrogen production technologies. They range from the most widely used fossil fuel based systems such as natural gas steam methane reforming to the least used renewable energy based systems such as wind electrolysis. Currently almost all the industrial hydrogen need worldwide is produced using fossil fuels. Electrolytic hydrogen production based on electricity generated from renewable resources and hydrogen's energetic use could contribute to the global need for a sustainable energy supply. However, these technologies are also not free from environmental burdens. A life cycle assessment (LCA) helps to identify such impacts considering the entire life cycle of the process chains. This paper reviews twenty-one studies that address the LCA of hydrogen production technologies, a majority of them employing electrolytic technologies. It has been observed that global warming potential (GWP) is the impact category analyzed by almost all the authors. Acidification potential (AP) ranks second. Other categories such as toxicity potential are often not analyzed. The main environmental concern associated with electrolytic hydrogen production is electricity supply. The GWP contribution of the electrolyzer unit is relatively small (e.g. only about 4\% in wind based electrolysis including hydrogen production and storage systems). From an LCA perspective, it can be concluded that electrolysis using wind or hydropower generated electricity is one of the best hydrogen production technologies, compared to those using conventional grid electricity mix or fossil fuel feedstocks.},

	abstract = {In the current debates on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the mobility sector, hydrogen produced via water electrolysis from renewable electricity is commonly regarded to be a sustainable energy carrier with large potential for decarbonisation of the mobility sector. Directly produced at the refueling stations site, hydrogen greenhouse gas emissions are presently defined to be zero in e.g. the Directives of the European Union since emissions arising from the facilities construction are defined to be negligible. In order to check the validity of this assumption with respect to the latest technical developments in hydrogen supply, the present article aims to report the environmental performance of hydrogen being produced and compressed for mobility purposes. To this end, a state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with an on-site alkaline electrolyser is assessed, which was built and operated in Berlin. Assuming electricity supply from wind energy generation, a life cycle assessment for the complete value chain was carried out where primary data for the build-up of electrolyser and HRS were obtained during decommissioning of the station. The results show that the construction of HRS and on-site electrolyser requires higher material and energy expenditures compared to previous investigations on similar but technically less advanced systems. These expenditures generate a significant footprint in the specific e.g. greenhouse gas emissions if the electrolyser is operated at a reduced load factor as it may be foreseen for grid stabilisation purposes. To ensure a strong reduction of emissions compared to conventional fuels, this load factor should be sufficiently high and should be defined to not fall under a certain threshold in upcoming directives. Besides, excessive use of supplies should be avoided and the refueling station should be operated with renewable electricity to the largest extent.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is often considered the best means by which to store energy coming from renewable and intermittent power sources. With the growing capacity of localized renewable energy sources surpassing the gigawatt range, a storage system of equal magnitude is required. PEM electrolysis provides a sustainable solution for the production of hydrogen, and is well suited to couple with energy sources such as wind and solar. However, due to low demand in electrolytic hydrogen in the last century, little research has been done on PEM electrolysis with many challenges still unexplored. The ever increasing desire for green energy has rekindled the interest on PEM electrolysis, thus the compilation and recovery of past research and developments is important and necessary. In this review, PEM water electrolysis is comprehensively highlighted and discussed. The challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts, solid electrolyte, current collectors, separator plates and modeling efforts will also be addressed. The main message is to clearly set the state-of-the-art for the PEM electrolysis technology, be insightful of the research that is already done and the challenges that still exist. This information will provide several future research directions and a road map in order to aid scientists in establishing PEM electrolysis as a commercially viable hydrogen production solution.},

Despite the smaller mean crystallite size, the Ir-black electrocatalyst shows significantly lower initial performance than the Ir-oxide. During operation at high current density, the Ir-black shows a decrease of cell potential with time whereas the Ir-oxide catalyst shows increasing cell potential resulting in a degradation rate of about 10 μV/h, approaching 1000 h. The unusual behaviour of the Ir-black results from the oxidation of metallic Ir to IrOx. The Ir-oxide catalyst shows instead a hydrated structure on the surface and a negative shift of about 0.5 eV for the Ir 4f binding energy after 1000 h electrolysis operation. This corresponds to the formation of a sub-stoichiometric Ir-oxide on the surface. These results indicate that a hydrated IrO2 with high oxidation state on the surface is favourable in decreasing the oxygen evolution overpotential. Modifications of the Ir chemical oxidation state during operation can affect significantly the catalytic activity and durability of the electrolysis system.},

	abstract = {The need for energy storage to balance intermittent and inflexible electricity supply with demand is driving interest in conversion of renewable electricity via electrolysis into a storable gas. But, high capital cost and uncertainty regarding future cost and performance improvements are barriers to investment in water electrolysis. Expert elicitations can support decision-making when data are sparse and their future development uncertain. Therefore, this study presents expert views on future capital cost, lifetime and efficiency for three electrolysis technologies: alkaline (AEC), proton exchange membrane (PEMEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). Experts estimate that increased R\&D funding can reduce capital costs by 0–24\%, while production scale-up alone has an impact of 17–30\%. System lifetimes may converge at around 60,000–90,000 h and efficiency improvements will be negligible. In addition to innovations on the cell-level, experts highlight improved production methods to automate manufacturing and produce higher quality components. Research into SOECs with lower electrode polarisation resistance or zero-gap AECs could undermine the projected dominance of PEMEC systems. This study thereby reduces barriers to investment in water electrolysis and shows how expert elicitations can help guide near-term investment, policy and research efforts to support the development of electrolysis for low-carbon energy systems.},

Cell and interconnect production is generally responsible for most of the impacts on the environment and human health, while differences between stacks due to differing air electrode materials are low.

With the increased interest in a hydrogen (H2) economy, the life-cycle environmental performance of H2 production has special significance for assisting in identifying opportunities to improve environmental performance and to guide challenging decisions and select between technology paths. Life cycle impact assessment methods are rapidly evolving to analyze multiple environmental impacts of the production of products or processes. This study marks the first step in developing process-based streamlined life cycle analysis (LCA) of several H2 production pathways combining life cycle impacts at the midpoint (17 problem-oriented) and endpoint (3 damage-oriented) levels using the state-of-the-art impact assessment method ReCiPe 2016. Steam reforming of natural gas, coal gasification, water electrolysis via proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM), solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC), biomass gasification and reforming, and dark fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass were analyzed. An innovative aspect is developed in this study is an analysis of water consumption associated with H2 production pathways by life-cycle stage to provide a better understanding of the life cycle water-related impacts on human health and natural environment. For water-related scope, Water scarcity footprint (WSF) quantified using Available WAter REmaining (AWARE) method was applied as a stand-alone indicator. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each production pathway, identify the drivers of environmental impact, quantify midpoint environmental impact and its influence on the endpoint environmental performance. The findings of this study could serve as a useful theoretical reference and practical basis to decision-makers of potential environmental impacts of H2 production systems.},

At the same time, in its deregulated electricity market, the adoption of clean/renewable based power generation technology may be hindered by a market pricing mechanism that does not reflect externality costs. For a sustainable power supply, there is a need to change the conventional appraisal techniques. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) are good tools to quantify environmental impacts and economic implications. LCA and LCCA are performed for centralised and distributed power generation technologies in Singapore, namely, oil and Orimulsion-fired steam turbines, natural gas-fired combined cycle plant, solar PV and fuel cell systems.

The second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources. However, even such “clean” hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle perspective within the time frame considered.},

	abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of biogas-fed Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) integrated with a CO2 recovery system is presented in this work. The goal of the work is to evaluate the environmental performance of an SOFC fueled with sewage biogas and to compare it with traditional technologies (internal combustion engines and microturbines) using the same fuel. CO2 recovery is performed through a tubular photobioreactor, fixing the recovered carbon in the form of a micro-algae. The analysis takes into account both the biogas production line (anaerobic digester) and its exploitation into the fuel cell (i.e., the power generator). Results show that the SOFC manufacturing activity is highly intensive since it requires a large amount of use of electricity. During operation, instead, the highest burden is associated with the fuel production. We analyzed two scenarios for biogas operation underlining the benefits of introducing sludge pre-thickening before the anaerobic digestion process. The use of a sludge pre-thickening system can reduce the inlet flow of natural gas into the plant, thus affecting the fuel chain contribution and reducing the overall impact. The photobioreactor results in consuming more energy than what it produces (looking at the operation phase only; the manufacturing phase was not even included) and being responsible for more carbon emissions than the amount fixed in algae. On the other side, data for the photobioreactor system were based on a real system at the proof-of-concept level. Therefore significant improvements are expected for an industrial-size system. Finally, the SOFC environmental burdens have been compared with main competitors in the same field (internal combustion engines and microturbines), showing the superior environmental performance. The proposed energy system is thus an interesting choice for cleaner energy production.},

	abstract = {Solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are an energy conversion device that theoretically has the capability of producing electrical energy for as long as the fuel and oxidant are supplied to the electrodes but performance is expected for, at least, 40,000h. In reality, performance degradation is observed in planar SOFC with metallic bipolar plate under steady and repeated thermal cycling conditions, which limits the practical operating life of these SOFCs. In this paper, the advances in SOFC are briefly summarized and the aging mechanisms of some components (anode, cathode and interconnect) in SOFC are discussed. The emphasis is given to aging mechanisms due to instability of materials and microstructures under real operation conditions. Identification of aging kinetics contributes to improvement in the stability of SOFC. It is indicated that development of new materials, optimization of microstructures and lower operating temperatures are desirable for the long-term stability of SOFC. Beneficial operation condition of SOFC is also proposed.},

	abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy systems are promoted and developed notably due to their low environmental footprint. Fleet-wide robust environmental assessments are needed to drive the sustainable transition of energy systems worldwide. This study introduces a tailored comprehensive impact assessment methodology for fleets of renewable energy systems based on Life Cycle Analysis and its application to Danish wind turbines fleet through an online platform LCA\_WIND\_DK (viewer.webservice-energy.org/lca-wind-dk/). This platform enables to visualize environmental performances of wind turbines in Denmark and their temporal evolution. The fleet is known in detail from 1980 to 2016 and projected from 2017 to 2030 based on national objectives for onshore/offshore capacity and pre-approved offshore projects. Each turbine‘s future electricity production is estimated from its power curve and geo-localized wind timeseries. More than 10,000 cradle-to-grave life cycle inventories are generated, considering the spatio-temporal context and technological characteristics. The comprehensive analysis of the Danish fleet over fifty years reveals long-term trends for several impact categories. Improvements in all categories follow similar trends as in climate change, which decreases from 40 to 13 g CO2-eq/kWh between 1980 and 2030. Improvements stem from combined economies of scale and higher load factors linked to increasingly large and powerful turbines. The interactive mapping tool LCA\_WIND\_DK may provide statistics to support renewable energy oriented policy scenarios and unique spatiotemporal environmental information to project developers. This novel approach designed for large territories, here applied to the Danish wind turbine fleet, is generic and can be applied to other renewable energy systems and/or to other territories.},

The attention is then focused on the electrode materials presently considered the most promising for enhancing the energy density of the batteries. At the anode side a discussion is provided on the status of development of high capacity tin and silicon lithium alloys. We show that the morphology that is the most likely to ensure commercial exploitation of these alloy electrodes is that involving carbon-based nanocomposites. We finally touch on super-high-capacity batteries, discussing the key cases of lithium-sulfur and lithium-air and attempting to forecast their chances to eventually reach the status of practically appealing energy storage systems. We conclude with a brief reflection on the amount of lithium reserves in view of its large use in the case of global conversion from gasoline-powered cars to hybrid and electric cars.},

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the environmental impacts related to the provision of 1kWh to the grid from wind power in Europe and to suggest how life cycle assessment can inform technology development and system planning. Four representative power plants onshore (with 2.3 and 3.2MW turbines) and offshore (4.0 and 6.0MW turbines) with 2015 state-of-the-art technology data provided by Siemens Wind Power were assessed. The energy payback time was found to be less than 1year for all technologies. The emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to less than 7g CO2-eq/kWh for onshore and 11g CO2-eq/kWh for offshore. Climate change impacts were found to be a good indicator for overall hotspot identification however attention should also be drawn to human toxicity and impacts from respiratory inorganics. The overall higher impact of offshore plants, compared to onshore ones, is mainly due to larger high-impact material requirements for capital infrastructure. In both markets the bigger turbines with more advanced direct drive generator technology is shown to perform better than the smaller geared ones. Capital infrastructure is the most impactful life cycle stage across impacts. It accounts for more than 79\% and 70\% of climate change impacts onshore and offshore respectively. The end-of-life treatment could lead to significant savings due to recycling, ca. 20–30\% for climate change. In the manufacturing stage the impacts due to operations at the case company do not exceed 1\% of the total life cycle impacts. This finding highlights the shared responsibility across multiple stakeholders and calls for collaborative efforts for comprehensive environmental management across organizations in the value chain. Real life examples are given in order to showcase how LCA results can inform decisions, e.g. for concept and product development and supply chain management. On a systems level the results can be used by energy planners when comparing with alternative energy sources.},
